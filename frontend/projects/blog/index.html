                <h3>About Greenland Shark:</h3>
                <br>
                 <p class="shark" style="font-size: large;">
                    <img src="./images/greenland_shark.jpg" alt="" class="image">The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), also known as the gurry shark or grey shark, is a large shark of the family Somniosidae ("sleeper sharks"), closely related to the Pacific and southern sleeper sharks. Inhabiting the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, they are notable for their exceptional longevity, although they are poorly studied due to the depth and remoteness of their natural habitat.
    
                    Greenland sharks have the longest lifespan of any known vertebrate, estimated to be between 250 and 500 years. They are among the largest extant shark species, reaching a maximum confirmed length of 6.4 m (21 ft) long and weighing over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). They reach sexual maturity at about 150 years of age, and their pups are born alive after an estimated gestation period of 8 to 18 years. The shark is a generalist feeder, consuming a variety of available foods, including carrion.
                    
                    Greenland shark meat is toxic to mammals due to its high levels of trimethylamine N-oxide, although a treated form of it is eaten in Iceland as a delicacy known as kæstur hákarl. Because they live deep in remote parts of the northern oceans, Greenland sharks are not considered a threat to humans. A possible attack occurred in August 1936 on two British fishermen, but the species was never identified.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: large;">The Greenland shark has the longest known lifespan of all vertebrate species. It is estimated that the species has a lifespan of at least 272 years, with the oldest individual estimated to be 392 ± 120 years of age. Estimates of age were made using radiocarbon dating of crystals within the lenses of their eyes. Greenland sharks are estimated to reach sexual maturity at around 150 years of age at which point females measure around 4.19 ± 0.04 meters and males measure around 2.84 ± 0.06 meters. One Greenland shark was tagged off the coast of Greenland in 1936 and recaptured in 1952. Its measurements suggest that Greenland sharks grow at a rate of 0.5–1 cm (1⁄4–1⁄2 in) per year. Efforts to conserve Greenland sharks are particularly important due to their extreme longevity, long maturation periods, and the heightened sensitivity of large shark populations. There are also efforts to understand exceptional Greenland shark longevity on the molecular level. Several published works suggest that expansion of transposable elements may play a crucial role. The longer duration and complexity of the female maturation reflect sex differences in reproductive biology. Females undergo seven distinct maturation stages: immature, developing, ripening, early gravid, midterm gravid, late gravid, and post-natal. Males undergo three stages: immature, maturing, and mature. These additional stages in females are necessary for their larger size, preparation for pregnancy, and the eventual birth of a large number of pups.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: large;">The shark has historically been hunted for its liver oil up until the development of synthetic oils and cessation of export of liver oil and skin from Greenland in the 1960s. In the 1970s, the species was seen as a problem for other fisheries in western Norway and the government subsidized a fishery to reduce the stock of the species. Today, the Greenland shark is primarily caught as bycatch in industrial fisheries. While about 25 Greenland sharks are caught per year by artisanal fisheries targeting the species in Iceland, 3,500 are caught annually as bycatch in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.</p>
